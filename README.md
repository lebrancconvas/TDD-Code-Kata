# TDD Code Kata

## Overview

Doing Code Kata for practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) ?

"Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of writing code that involves writing an automated unit-level test case that fails, then writing just enough code to make the test pass, then refactoring both the test code and the production code, then repeating with another new test case." ([TDD's Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))

## What is Code Kata ?

"Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar." ([CodeKata.com](http://codekata.com/))
